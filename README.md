# Kaggle-Titanic
Kaggle Titanic Competition 

### Introduction
The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. I will follow the steps including EDA and Feature Engineering, and model training to predict as accurate as possible. I probably will put EDA and FE together since the data is quite simple and small.

### Key Takeaways from the Data Analysis
1. In general, Females (72% survived) are much more likely to survive than man (19% survived).
2. Passengers below 20 years are most likely to survive (45% survived). Those aged 20-40 years are less likely (40 % survived), and those who aged more than 40 years old have the least chance of survival (40%).
3. Passengers in Class 1 are way likely to survive (63%) than those in Passenger class 2(47%), and those in passenger class 2 are way likely to survive than those in class 3(24%). Moreover, the death cases in Passenger class 2 and 3 mostly come from passengers aged from 20 to 30. 
4. Passengers embarked from Cherbourg have significantly more chances of survival (55%) than those embarked in other locations, where passengers from Southampton has survival rate of 34% and those from Queenstown has 38% survival rate. Southampton has the most amount passengers embarked and there are least passengers embarked from Queenstown.
5. Passengers with exactly 1 siblings or spouse are most likely to survive with about 50% survival rate.
