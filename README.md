Kaggle Titanic Competition 

### Introduction
The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. I will follow the steps including EDA and Feature Engineering, and model training to predict as accurate as possible. I probably will put EDA and FE together since the data is quite simple and small.

### Key Takeaways from the Data Analysis
1. In general, Females (72% survived) are much more likely to survive than man (19% survived).
2. Passengers below 20 years are most likely to survive (45% survived). Those aged 20-40 years are less likely (40 % survived), and those who aged more than 40 years old have the least chance of survival (40%).
3. Passengers in Class 1 are way likely to survive than those in Passenger class 2, and those in passenger class 2 are way likely to survive than those in class 3. Moreover, the death cases in Passenger class 2 and 3 mostly come from passengers aged from 20 to 30. 
4. Passengers embarked from Cherbourg have significantly more chances of survival than those embarked in other locations. Southampton has the most amount passengers embarked, and those who aged 20 to 30 embarked from there have about 50% chance to die. There are least passengers embarked from Queenstown, yet almost every passenger embarked from there died.
