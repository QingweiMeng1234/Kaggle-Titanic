# Kaggle-Titanic
Kaggle Titanic Competition 

### Introduction
The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. I will follow the steps including EDA and Feature Engineering, and model training to predict as accurate as possible. I probably will put EDA and FE together since the data is quite simple and small.
